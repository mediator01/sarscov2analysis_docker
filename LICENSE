Copyright Swift Biosciences Inc. (c) 2017

All rights reserved.

This Swift Biosciences Open Source Software License ("License") is between you
("User") and Swift Biosciences, Inc. ("Swift") for Swift"s software and library
tools for soft-clipping Swift"s sequences for Accel-Amplicon® Panels, including
the Accel-Amplicon® master file and the Primerclip Script.

The License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works,
specifically designed to ensure cooperation, including in the case of network
server software. This License is intended to guarantee User's freedom to share
and change all versions of our Program.

This License states the complete agreement between User and Swift for the
Program. User agrees to carefully read this License, and any other terms and
conditions, user guide or documents provided in connection with this License
before installing, accessing or using the Program.

By downloading and/or installing the Program, User agrees to the valid and
binding terms of this Agreement.

User may print a copy of this Agreement.

For clarity, by installing, accessing or otherwise using the Program, User
acknowledges that it has read and agrees to be bound by this Agreement. If User
is not willing to be bound by this Agreement, then User must not install,
access or use the Program.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1.	Definitions.
1.1	"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the
Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
additional permissions.
1.2	An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is
no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy
of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
1.3	To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
1.4	The "Corresponding Source" for a work in Object Code form means all the
Source Code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
Object Code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries,
or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
associated with source files for the work, and the Source Code for shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source
need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other
parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in
Source Code form is that same work.
1.5	"Covered Work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program.
1.6	A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential Component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
Object Code interpreter used to run it.
1.7	"Modify" means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion
requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a "Modified Version" of the earlier work or a work
"based on" the earlier work.
1.8	The "Program" refers to Swift's software and library tools for
soft-clipping Swift's sequences for Accel-Amplicon® Panels, including the
Accel-Amplicon® master file and the Primerclip Script.
1.9	To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make User directly or secondarily liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying
a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
activities as well.
1.10	The "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.
1.11	The "Swift GitHub Repository" is located at
https://github.com/swiftbiosciences/primerclip
1.12	The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging
a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to
implement a standard interface for which an implementation is available to the
public in Source Code form.  A standard interface means an interface that
either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one
that is widely used among developers working in that language.
2.	License Granted.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the terms and conditions of this
License are met.  This License explicitly affirms User's unlimited permission
to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a Covered Work is
covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a
Covered Work.  This License acknowledges User's rights of fair use or other
equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
User may make, run and propagate Covered Works, without conditions, that User
does not convey, so long as this License otherwise remains in force. User may
convey Covered Works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
modifications exclusively for User, or provide User with facilities for running
those works, provided that User complies with the terms of this License in
conveying all material for which User does not control copyright. Therefore,
those making or running the Covered Works for User must do so exclusively on
User's behalf, under User's direction and control, on terms that prohibit them
from making any copies of User's copyrighted material outside of their
relationship with User.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.
3.	Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No Covered Work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
restricting circumvention of such measures. When User conveys a Covered Work,
User waives any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures
to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this
License with respect to the Covered Work, and User disclaims any intention to
limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, User's or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention
of technological measures.
4.	Conveying Exact Copies.
User may convey exact copies of the Program's Source Code as User receives it,
in any medium, provided that User:
(a)	conspicuously and appropriately publishes on each copy the following
copyright notice:
This software and library tools are for soft-clipping Swift's sequences for
Accel-Amplicon® Panels, including the Accel-Amplicon® master file and the
Primerclip Script. Copyright (C) 2017  Swift Biosciences, Inc. This program is
free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
Swift Biosciences Open Source License as published by Swift Biosciences, Inc.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; WITHOUT EVEN THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
See the Swift Open Source License for more details. You should have received a
copy of the Swift Open Source License along with this program. If not, see
https://github.com/swiftbiosciences/primerclip/blob/master/LICENSE, email
TechSupport@swiftbiosci.com, or write to

Swift Biosciences Inc.
58 Parkland Plaza Ste 100

to request a copy of the Swift Open Source License.
(b)	keeps intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with Section 7 apply to the code;
(c)	keeps intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
(d)	gives all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
User may charge any price or no price for each copy that it conveys, and User
may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
5.	Conveying Modified Source Versions.
5.1	User may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program in the form of Source Code under the terms of
Section 4, provided that the following conditions are met:
(a) 	The work must be uploaded to the Swift GitHub Repository;
(b)	The work must carry prominent notices stating that User modified it, and
giving a relevant date;
(c) 	The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
this License and any conditions added under Section 7, which modifies the
requirement in Section 4 to "keep intact all notices";
(d) 	User must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply,
along with any applicable Section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work,
and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
such permission if User separately received it; and
(e) 	Each user interfaces must display Appropriate Legal Notices.

5.2	An "aggregate" is a compilation of a Covered Work with other separate and
independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the Covered Work
and not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium; such a compilation shall be an aggregate only
if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access
or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
permit. Inclusion of a Covered Work in an aggregate does not cause this License
to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
6.	Conveying Non-Source Forms.
User may convey a Covered Work in Object Code form under the terms of Sections
4 and 5, provided that it also conveys the machine-readable Corresponding
Source under the terms of this License to the Swift GitHub Repository.
A separable portion of the Object Code, whose Source Code is excluded from the
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the
Object Code work.
7.	Additional Terms.
When User conveys a copy of a Covered Work, User may remove any additional
permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions
may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when User modifies
the work.)  User may place additional permissions on material, added by User to
a Covered Work, for which User has or can give appropriate copyright
permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
User adds to a Covered Work, User may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
(a)	Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
Sections 14 and 15 of this License;
(b)	Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by
works containing it;
(c)	Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring
that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as
different from the original version;
(d)	Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of
the material;
(e)	Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
trademarks, or service marks; or
(f)	 Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions"
within the meaning of Section 10.  If the Program as User received it, or any
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along
with a term that is a further restriction, User may remove that term. If a
license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
conveying under this License, User may add to a Covered Work material governed
by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction
does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If User adds terms to a Covered
Work in accord with this Section, User must place, in the relevant source
files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a
notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
apply either way.
8.	Termination.
8.1	User may not propagate or modify a Covered Work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it
is void, and will automatically terminate User's rights under this License
(including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of Section 9).
Termination of User's rights under this Section does not terminate the licenses
of parties who have received copies or rights from User under this License.
If User's rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, User does
not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under Section 9.
8.2	If User ceases all violation of this License, then User's license from
Swift is reinstated
(a) provisionally, unless and until Swift explicitly terminates User's license,
and
(b) permanently, if Swift fails to notify User of the violation by some
reasonable means, including but not limited to by e-mail, prior to sixty (60)
days after the cessation. Moreover, User's license from Swift is reinstated
permanently if Swift notifies User of the violation by some reasonable means,
this is the first time User received notice of violation of this License (for
any work) from Swift, and User cures the violation prior to thirty (30) days
after receipt of the notice.
9.	Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time User conveys a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from Swift to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this
License. User is not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If an entity transaction causes the
propagation of a Covered Work, each party to that transaction who receives a
copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a
right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
reasonable efforts.
User may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, User may not impose a
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this
License, and User may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
portion of it.
10.	Patents.
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of
the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is
called the contributor's "contributor version".
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor
version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.
Each contributor grants User a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of
its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license"
is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a
patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a party
means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against
the party.
If User conveys a Covered Work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
network server or other readily accessible means, then User must either (1)
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
User of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means
User has actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, User conveying the
Covered Work in a country, or User's recipient's use of the Covered Work in a
country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that
User has reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, User
conveys, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a Covered Work, and grant a
patent license to some of the parties receiving the Covered Work authorizing
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the Covered Work,
then the patent license User grants is automatically extended to all recipients
of the Covered Work and works based on it.
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of
its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise
of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.
User may not convey a Covered Work if User is a party to an arrangement with a
third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which user
makes payment to the third party based on the extent of User's activity of
conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the Covered Work from User, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the Covered Work conveyed by User
(or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
specific products or compilations that contain the Covered Work, unless User
entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28
March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
available to User under applicable patent law.
11.	No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on user (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
User from the conditions of this License.  If User cannot convey a Covered Work
so as to satisfy simultaneously User's obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence User may not convey it at
all. For example, if User agrees to terms that obligate User to collect a
royalty for further conveying from those to whom User conveys the Program,
the only way User could satisfy both those terms and this License would be
to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
12.	Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if User modifies the
Program, and users can interact with the modified program remotely through a
computer network User must license it under and comply with all aspects of this
Agreement with respect to such modified program, including providing Swift and
others an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of User's version by
providing access to the Corresponding Source through the Swift GitHub
Repository at no charge. This Corresponding Source shall include the
Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General
Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, User has permission to
link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the
resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part
which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain
governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
13.	Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING SWIFT AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE
THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS BORNE BY USER.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, USER SHALL ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.
14.	Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL SWIFT, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO USER FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY USER OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
15.	Interpretation of Sections 13 and 14.  If the disclaimer of warranty and
limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect
according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection
with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
